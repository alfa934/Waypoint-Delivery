1) Record X and Y data from HMC5883L (use Find_HMC5883L_Offset.ino)
   -> Rotate to 360 degrees (take as much data as you want)

2) Place data in Excel (X and Y columns)
   -> Circular graph (recommended)

3) Filter out outlier data

4) Find MIN and MAX data for X and Y

5) offset = (MAX + MIN)/2
   -> offset_X = (max_X + min_X)/2
      etc...
